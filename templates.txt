1. Templates directory is created to contain html code for different components
2. To make sure templates are added we need to configure in settings.py
3.configure in settings.py like below mentioned
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [
            BASE_DIR / 'templates'

        ],

4. django provides inheritance for html pages.
5. for example we can include content from one different html page to another by using `{% include 'htmlpage.html' %}`
    in desired html page
6. we can wrap different html pages in one main html page by using

{% block content %}

{% endblock %}

for reference see main.html
